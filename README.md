# Dear Next Visitor

A tiny social experiment in kindness and serendipity. Leave a message for the next visitor and receive the previous visitor’s message in return. One-in, one-out. Anonymous, ephemeral, and lightly moderated for safety.

What is this?
- A small place on the internet to pass along a thought to a stranger.
- No accounts, no feeds, no likes. Just a single message, passed from person to person.

How it works
1. You write a short note for the next visitor.
2. After you submit, you receive the note left by the person before you.
3. Your note becomes the next thing a stranger will read.

Why it exists
- To encourage small acts of connection between people who don’t know each other.
- To create a quiet space on the web with no friction and no agenda.
- To remind us that words can travel far in simple ways.

Safety & privacy
- Messages are anonymous and transient. Please don’t include personal information.
- Automated checks reduce obvious abuse, but nothing is perfect. Proceed kindly.
- High-level analytics help understand usage, but there’s no user tracking or accounts.

Questions
- What can I write? Anything thoughtful, kind, funny, or sincere. Avoid spam, links, and personal data.
- Can I read more than one message? No, the exchange is one-to-one by design.
- Is this open source? Yes, the code is here for transparency and curiosity.
